## GitHub Repositories Are Being Banned üö´
**The reason is the usage of certain words in repository names such as: Hack, Cheat, Hacking Tool, Game Name, Hvnc, Rat, etc.**

Furthermore, tags within repositories are also subject to restrictions. These limitations prevent the utilization of specific keywords I have positioned at the beginning of projects' tags, which are intended to enhance their discoverability.

Instead of furnishing the executable, I will ensure the requisite source code is available for your perusal.
